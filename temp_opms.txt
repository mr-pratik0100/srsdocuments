Online Project Management System

1. Introduction

The Online Project Management System is a web-based application that enables organizations and
project teams to efficiently plan, track, and manage projects. The system provides a centralized
platform for creating projects, assigning tasks, tracking progress, collaborating, and generating reports.
It aims to streamline project management processes, enhance communication, and improve overall project efficiency.

2. Functional Requirements

2.1 User Management
The system shall provide user registration and authentication functionality.
Users shall be able to create accounts and log in using their credentials.
The system shall support different user roles, such as administrators, project managers, and team members.

2.2 Project Creation and Management
Project managers shall be able to create new projects and define project details (e.g., project name, start date, end date, description).
Projects shall have a unique identifier and can be assigned to specific teams.
Project managers shall have the ability to update project details and archive completed projects.

2.3 Task Management
Project managers shall be able to create tasks within projects, assign them to team members, and set due dates.
Tasks shall have attributes such as task name, description, priority, and status.
Team members shall be able to update the status of assigned tasks, mark them as completed, and add comments or attachments.

2.4 Collaboration and Communication
The system shall facilitate communication and collaboration among project team members.
Users shall be able to exchange messages, comments, and files related to tasks or projects.
Notifications shall be sent to users for task assignments, updates, and deadlines.

2.5 Project Tracking and Reporting
The system shall provide real-time project progress tracking.
Users shall be able to view project timelines, milestones, and task dependencies.
The system shall generate reports on project status, task completion rates, and resource utilization.

2.6 Document Management
The system shall support document sharing and version control for project-related files.
Users shall be able to upload, access, and manage project documents securely.
The system shall maintain a revision history of documents and allow users to restore previous versions if needed.

3. Non-Functional Requirements

3.1 Security
User authentication and sensitive information shall be securely stored and transmitted.
Access to projects, tasks, and documents shall be controlled based on user roles and permissions.
The system shall implement encryption and secure communication protocols to protect data.

3.2 Performance
The system shall handle multiple concurrent users and provide responsive performance.
Response times for user interactions, such as creating tasks or generating reports, shall be within acceptable limits.

3.3 User Interface
The system shall have an intuitive and user-friendly interface.
The user interface shall be responsive and compatible with different devices and screen sizes.

3.4 Integration
The system shall integrate with popular calendar applications to synchronize project timelines and task deadlines.
Integration with email services shall allow users to receive notifications and updates via email.

4. Constraints

4.1 Technology Constraints
The system shall be developed as a web-based application using HTML, CSS, and JavaScript for the frontend.
The backend shall be implemented using a server-side programming language (e.g., Python, Java, PHP) and a suitable database management system (e.g., MySQL, PostgreSQL).

5. Assumptions and Dependencies

5.1 Assumptions
Users have access to a modern web browser to interact with the system.
An internet connection is required to access the online project management system.
Users will provide valid and accurate information during registration and project/task management.

5.2 Dependencies
The system will rely on external email services to send notifications to users.
Integration with third-party calendar applications will depend on the availability and compatibility of those services.
This is just an example, and the actual SRS document may vary based on specific project requirements and stakeholder preferences.

6.Conclusion

In conclusion, the Online Project Management System is designed to provide organizations and project teams with a comprehensive
web-based platform for efficient project planning, tracking, and management. The system's functional requirements encompass user
management, project creation and management, task management, collaboration and communication, project tracking and reporting, and
document management. Non-functional requirements include security measures, performance optimization, a user-friendly interface, and
integrations with external services. By implementing this system, organizations can streamline their project management processes,
enhance communication and collaboration, and ultimately improve project efficiency and success.
