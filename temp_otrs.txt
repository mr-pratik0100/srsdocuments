Online Ticket Reservation System
1. Introduction

The Online Ticket Reservation System is a web-based application that allows users to search
for and reserve tickets for various events, such as concerts, movies, sports events, and theater shows.
The system provides an easy and convenient way for users to browse available events,
view seat availability, make reservations, and purchase tickets online.

2. Scope
The scope of the online ticket reservation application includes user management, event management,
event search and browsing, seat selection and reservation, ticket purchase, booking confirmation,
and adherence to non-functional requirements. It aims to provide users with a platform to register and authenticate,
browse and search for events, select and reserve seats, purchase tickets securely, receive booking confirmations,
and ensure performance, security, user-friendliness, and reliability of the system. The scope may vary based on
specific project requirements and can be adjusted to accommodate additional features as needed.

4.4 Availability and Reliability
The system shall have a high availability rate to ensure users can access it at all times.
The system shall handle errors gracefully and provide appropriate error messages to users.

5. Constraints
5.1 Technology Constraints
The system shall be developed as a web-based application using a combination of HTML, CSS, and JavaScript for the frontend.
The backend shall be implemented using a server-side programming language (e.g., Python, Java, PHP) and a suitable database
management system (e.g., MySQL, PostgreSQL).

6. Assumptions and Dependencies
6.1 Assumptions
Users have access to a modern web browser to interact with the system.
An internet connection is required to access the online ticket reservation system.
Users will provide valid and accurate information during registration and ticket purchase.

6.2 Dependencies
The system will depend on the availability and proper functioning of the payment gateway for online transactions.
The system will rely on external email services to send booking confirmations to users.
This is just an example, and the actual SRS document may vary based on specific project requirements.
